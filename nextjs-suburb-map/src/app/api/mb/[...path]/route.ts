 * GET /api/mb/v1/... → GET https://api.microburbs.com.au/v1/...
 *
 * The browser never sees the key: it calls this route, and this route calls
 * the API with MICROBURBS_API_KEY added on the server. The response body is
 * passed through untouched, plus a few headers the request inspector shows:
 *
 *   x-upstream-url   the URL we called (no key in it)
 *   x-upstream-ms    how long the API took
 *   x-cache          HIT when this app answered from its own cache
 *   x-request-id     the API's request id, worth quoting if you ask for help
 *
 * Only GET requests under /v1/ are forwarded, and only for the sandbox
 * suburbs and sample properties (src/lib/sandbox.ts): anything else gets a
 * 403 here without reaching the API. If you deploy this app with your own
 * key, anyone can use this route with it, so add your own auth first.
