 * Sample listing photos. The API's listings carry no photos, so each listing

 * same photo. Houses get house photos, units get apartment photos. Every place
 * that shows one labels it "Sample photo".
 *
 * The files are self-hosted in public/photos: 1200x800 webp, plus a 640px
 * "-sm" version for cards.
